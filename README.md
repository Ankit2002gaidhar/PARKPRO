PARK PRO

1]Problem Statement :Parking in crowded public spaces often results in closely parked vehicles, causing difficulties for car owners to easily retrieve their cars. 
This impediment in egress disrupts schedules, increases frustration, and poses safety risks. 
There is a need for a solution that ensures efficient and hassle-free parking in such scenarios.

2]Objective:The primary objective of our project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly parking solution that utilizes QR code stickers on vehicles.
This system will enable vehicle users to scan QR codes on blocked vehicles, allowing them to send notifications to the owners of those vehicles, 
thus fostering better communication and resolving parking-related issues in a more organized and cooperative manner.

3]Methodology:  
  1]Develop a QR sticker system that enables vehicle owners to notify and resolve blocked parking incidents efficiently.
  2]Utilize a QR code generation tool to create unique QR codes linked to each vehicle's registration.
  3]Apply a waterproof QR code sticker on the rear windshield of each vehicle
  4]Set up a secure database to store vehicle information, QR code associations, and owner contact details.
  5]Design a simple and intuitive interface within the web app to trigger notifications.
  6]Gain valuable insights through our advanced analytics capabilities, enabling data-driven decision-making and identifying growth opportunities.
  7]Establish a real-time notification delivery mechanism, ensuring prompt message delivery to the blocking vehicle owner.
  8]Integrate a feature allowing the blocking vehicle owner to confirm the resolution after removing their vehicle
  9]Specify the step-by-step process for a user to scan the QR code and initiate the notification
  10]Establish a real-time notification delivery mechanism, ensuring prompt message delivery to the blocking vehicle owner.
  11]Integrate a feature allowing the blocking vehicle owner to confirm the resolution after removing their vehicle.
  12]Implement encryption and data security measures to protect user information and privacy.

4]Conclusion:
After successful implementation of our project, aimed at enhancing parking egress in closely packed public parking spaces, 
we anticipate a significant solution to the problem of "being boxed in" or experiencing a "blocked exit".
The proposed solution will employ innovative parking management technique, utilizing smart parking technologies and implementing better solution to congested parking.
